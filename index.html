   <h2> My first website for github</h2> 
   <p>Version Control: GitHub helps manage and store revisions of projects, allowing multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work </p>
   <p>Repositories (Repos): Projects on GitHub are stored in repositories. Each repository can contain folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets â€“ anything your project needs.</p>
   <p>This feature allows you to host websites directly from a GitHub repository, which is useful for project documentation and personal portfolios.</p>
